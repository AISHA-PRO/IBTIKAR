          We invest in highly-skilled and complementary management teams that
          are willing to take risks and go out of their comfort zones. If you’ve
          never launched a company before, expect to work the hardest you have
          ever worked, to have good and bad days, to be challenged and to be
          inspired. Launching a company is not easy but it will be one of the
          most rewarding experiences of your life.
        </p>
        <p className="col-lg-12">
          We look for ideas that are innovative, primarily, but not only in the
          tech fields. We invest in ideas that have a regional or global market
          and that answer real market needs.

          <strong>How To Approach Ibtikar</strong>
        </h3>
        <p className="col-lg-12">
          Our management team is ready to consider the ideas of any entrepreneur
          exploring an investment. Please email us at
          <a href="mailto:info@ibtikarfund.com">info@ibtikarfund.com</a> inorder
          to present us with your idea or company.
        </p>
        <p className="col-lg-12">
          In order to help us review your idea or startup company, we ask for an
          Executive Summary and Company Presentation (you may download the
          guidelines for both below). Read through and follow our guidelines, we
          have developed them to make the process as easy as possible for you.
          Please give us at least two weeks to review these documents before we
          respond to your approach.
        </p>
        <p className="col-lg-12">
          We will provide you with our initial feedback, we may suggest a follow
          up meeting and, if we are interested in an investment, we will
          schedule a meeting to agree on a plan for our due diligence
          assessment, including, for example, meeting with some of your existing
          customers to validate your product. While we will be as expedient as
          possible in this due diligence process, this is an important step to
          ensure that we are stewarding our investors’ money to the best of our
          ability, so expect the due diligence process to take several months.
